if i upload a txt file containing female and male names ,you neglect initials , you convert them to lower case ,can you segregate male and female name and create python set (names in single quots) to that male and female names and return on command ,you can process 300 names each time. i mean first 300 once and then i will say next you can process next 300
if you cant group them whether they male or female you can return them in unknown python set
fyi the names are indian that too karnataka names
